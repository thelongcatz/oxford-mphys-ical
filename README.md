# The Oxford MPhys Timetable -> iCalendar Converter

This Python-based program provides the Oxford MPhys students a handy way of obtaining the term timetable in the [iCalendar](https://icalendar.org/Home.html) format.

Features:
- Inclusion of location so that one wouldn't have to run around Clarendon, only to discover that the lecture venue is in DWB.
- Automated collating of contiguous time slots, very useful for lab sessions
- URL of the corresponding time slot would also be added for convenience
